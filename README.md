# video-convertor-and-image-editor
It's a basic backend program of a video slicer and image editor.
User passes the parameters for image editing and the video is converted into images according to the frame rate.
Further implemetation can be done to this by developing the GUI which can helps us to drag and drop properties onto the image rather manually editing them.
